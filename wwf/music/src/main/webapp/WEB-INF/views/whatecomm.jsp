<table> <tr><td align=justify>Electronic commerce or ecommerce is a term for any type of business,
		or commercial transaction, that involves the transfer of information
		across the Internet. It covers a range of different types of
		businesses, from consumer based retail sites, through auction or music
		sites, to business exchanges trading goods and services between
		corporations. It is currently one of the most important aspects of the
		Internet to emerge. Ecommerce allows consumers to electronically
		exchange goods and services with no barriers of time or distance.
		Electronic commerce has expanded rapidly over the past five years and
		is predicted to continue at this rate, or even accelerate. In the near
		future the boundaries between "conventional" and "electronic" commerce
		will become increasingly blurred as more and more businesses move
		sections of their operations onto the Internet. Business to Business
		or B2B refers to electronic commerce between businesses rather than
		between a business and a consumer. B2B businesses often deal with
		hundreds or even thousands of other businesses, either as customers or
		suppliers. Carrying out these transactions electronically provides
		vast competitive advantages over traditional methods. When implemented
		properly, ecommerce is often faster, cheaper and more convenient than
		the traditional methods of bartering goods and services. Electronic
		transactions have been around for quite some time in the form of
		Electronic Data Interchange or EDI. EDI requires each supplier and
		customer to set up a dedicated data link (between them), where
		ecommerce provides a cost-effective method for companies to set up
		multiple, ad-hoc links. Electronic commerce has also led to the
		development of electronic marketplaces where suppliers and potential
		customers are brought together to conduct mutually beneficial trade.
		The road to creating a successful online store can be a difficult if
		unaware of ecommerce principles and what ecommerce is supposed to do
		for your online business. Researching and understanding the guidelines
		required to properly implement an e-business plan is a crucial part to
		becoming successful with online store building.</td>
